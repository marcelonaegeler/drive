# drive
An application to store user files (like Google Drive).
I'm developing this application mostly for study and test myself.

## How to run

0. Clone the source and got to "drive-node":

    git clone https://github.com/marcelonaegeler/drive-node.git && cd drive-node

0. Install node modules:

    npm install

0. Install bower modules:

    bower install

0. Run it:

    node app.js


## To do
* Recursive finder (to tree view);
* Recursive remove (problems with orphan children);
* Upload file and see how to store the data (the folders will really exist in the hard drive and the files will be organized inside?);
* Test it.
